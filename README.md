# LMZ Persist

This module is designed to provide convenience and utility for dealing with standard persistence patterns and
operations.

## Interfaces

A number of interfaces have been defined to provide predictable and standardised definition and configuration of
persistence entity data. The individual purposes of each interface should be defined in their respective javadoc
headers.

## Services

The only current Service of note is Saviour and SaviourService (its implementation). These provide a number of LMZ
best-practice operations for checking and manipulating persistence entities in a predictable and safe manner.
